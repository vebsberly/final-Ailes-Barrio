#### Ethical Hacking Technical Report
#### Client: [Shoppe]
#### Date: [May 11, 2024]
#### Prepared by: [Joana Marie S. Ailes] and [Veberly B. Barrio]


####_ Vulnerability Summary

## Outdated Software Versions

   * Several systems were found to be running outdated software versions, including operating systems, web servers, and third-party applications.

## Weak Passwords

   * Many user accounts were discovered with weak passwords, including default credentials and easily guessable combinations.

## Unsecured Network Services

   * Open ports and services were identified on the network, potentially exposing the organization to external attacks.

## Lack of Encryption

   * Data transmission between servers and clients was found to be unencrypted, putting sensitive information at risk of interception.

## Inadequate Security Controls

   * The organization lacked essential security controls such as intrusion detection/prevention systems and endpoint protection solutions.

## Missing Security Patches

  * Critical security patches were missing on various systems, leaving them vulnerable to known exploits.

## Insecure Configuration

  * Some systems were found to have insecure configurations, exposing them to potential exploitation.

## Insufficient Access Controls

  * Weak access controls were identified, allowing unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive data and systems.

## Exposed Administrative Interfaces

  * Administrative interfaces were found exposed to the internet without proper authentication mechanisms.

## Lack of Network Segmentation

  * The network lacked proper segmentation, allowing attackers to move laterally across systems once access is gained.
Recommendation: Implement network segmentation to isolate critical systems and limit the lateral movement of attackers in the event of a breach.

#### Recommendation

## Outdated Software Versions

  * Implement a patch management process to ensure all software is regularly updated with the latest security patches.

## Weak Passwords

  * Enforce strong password policies and provide security awareness training to employees on the importance of using complex passwords.

## Unsecured Network Services

  * Close unnecessary ports and services, and implement firewall rules to restrict access to authorized users.

## Lack of Encryption

  * Enable encryption protocols such as SSL/TLS to secure data in transit and protect against eavesdropping attacks.

## Inadequate Security Controls

  * Deploy comprehensive security solutions to monitor and protect the network from malicious activities.

## Missing Security Patches

  * Implement a robust patch management process to ensure timely application of security patches.

## Insecure Configuration

  * Conduct regular security configuration reviews and harden system configurations to minimize security risks.

## Insufficient Access Controls
  
  * Strengthen access controls by implementing least privilege principles and regularly reviewing user access rights.

## Exposed Administrative Interfaces
  
  * Restrict access to administrative interfaces and implement strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

## Lack of Network Segmentation

  * Implement network segmentation to isolate critical systems and limit the lateral movement of attackers in the event of a breach.

### Conclusion

  * The ethical hacking assessment identified critical vulnerabilities within [Shoppe]'s network infrastructure, applications, and systems. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to mitigating the risk of cyber attacks and protecting sensitive information. By implementing the recommended remediation measures, [Shoppe] can strengthen its security posture and enhance its ability to defend against evolving threats. A proactive approach to security, combined with ongoing monitoring and education, is essential to safeguarding [Shoppe]'s digital assets and maintaining customer trust.
